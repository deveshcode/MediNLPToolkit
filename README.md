# MediNLPToolkit: NLP-Powered Medical Note Analysis

## Overview
MediNLPToolkit is an innovative project designed to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to transform unstructured medical notes into structured, actionable insights. Our goal is to enhance patient care and streamline hospital administration by making the wealth of information in medical notes easily accessible and analyzable.

## Key Features
- **Automated Data Cleaning**: Sophisticated algorithms to clean and standardize text, including correcting typos and standardizing medical terminology.
- **Information Extraction**: Advanced NLP techniques to extract critical information such as symptoms, diagnoses, medications, and patient demographics from unstructured texts.
- **Feature Engineering for ML Models**: Preparation of structured data for machine learning models to predict health outcomes, treatment efficacy, and hospital resource needs.
- **Searchable Medical Notes**: A powerful search interface to quickly retrieve specific information from a vast database of medical notes, improving healthcare providers' efficiency.

## Getting Started
To begin using MediNLPToolkit, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MediNLPToolkit.git
    ```
2. **Install required packages**:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Read the documentation** in `docs/` for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## How It Works
MediNLPToolkit applies a series of text processing and NLP techniques to medical notes, turning unstructured text into a structured format that can be easily analyzed. This includes preprocessing, entity recognition, relationship extraction, and integration with machine learning models.
